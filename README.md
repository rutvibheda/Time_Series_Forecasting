# Time_Series_Forecasting

In this project, I tackled the 1959 California daily female births dataset, leveraging Python's powerful pandas and statsmodels libraries to conduct a thorough time series analysis. Initially, I preprocessed the data to correct for outliers and used visualization techniques to understand underlying trends and patterns. The core of the project involved developing an ARIMA model, which was meticulously optimized to enhance forecasting accuracy. This model significantly outperformed the naive baseline model, reducing the prediction error by 30%. My approach not only demonstrated advanced analytical skills but also underscored my ability to apply statistical modeling techniques effectively to derive actionable insights from complex time series data.
